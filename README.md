# HIVE PROJECT

For decades we have been promised that the 21st century would usher in an era of human and robotic companionship. date has came and gone and we have yet to see this promise fullfilled. And we arn't happy. The technology today surrounds us in bits and pieces and we arn't going to wait anylonger for anyone else to make it happen. It's time to start hacking.

HIVE is an open source project founded on cutting edge robotic mobility technology and a newly pioneered collaboration method. Our open contributor and member's goals are to establish, evolve and spread robotic colonies in urban cities around the world
